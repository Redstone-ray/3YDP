Spherical Parallel Manipulator by plusalphaDesigns on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3951917

Summary:
Inspired by videos on YouTube, I decided to make a functional model of a spherical parallel actuator. The 3-axes are controlled by small SG90 servomotors, which should be locally available. The top stage has 3mm diameter holes placed radially outwards in 12 directions spaced 12mm apart, so that other "gadgets" can potentially be mounted. Attached Arduino demo code will get the Manipulator up and running. It will demonstrate what kind of motions the Manipulator can make. It is only a demo so it will need some upgrade in order to meet specific needs. I considered designing the Manipulator with bearings for smoother motion, but I preferred designing something with minimal purchased parts, with the hope that it will be accessible to  a wider audience. I kept the locations of the screws to a minimum (only key locations such as the motor mount and the connection between the Links), and introduced using the 1.75mm Filament as a "locking Pin" to prevent things from falling apart.
